# stone-cloak-blade
A mystical twist on the classic game of rock, paper, scissors.

Some nights while traveling through the Lonely Forest, it can be difficult to fall asleep. You decide to take a stroll to the lake to gaze at the moon. As you approach the lake, there is a fallen tree branch that you sit on. The lake is sparkling from the moonlight. Suddenly, you hear a rustling behind you. You turn around--it's Ori! Ori wants to play stone, cloak, blade!

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This game uses three items: stone, cloak, and blade. Regardless of what item the user chooses, Ori's choice will be randomized so it is a fair game. In order to achieve this, the Math.random() method is used. 


### Lesson Learned

In order to keep track of the user and Ori's score, I learned to use a global variable and addition assignment operator to update scores.
